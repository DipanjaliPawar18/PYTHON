# python is a popular pprogramming language. 
# it was created by Guido Van Rossum and released in 1991.
# To print something in python we just have to use the print() function.
# the parenthesis with the print function 
# used to pass the statement which we want to print. 
print("hello world")

#python has similarities to the English language with influence from mathematics.
# as we want to print sum of two digits.... 
# all we have to do is just write them with the plus sign between the two
print(3+4) 

#another way
a=3  
b=4
# a and b are variables of type integer
print(a+b)

#we can also assign a string toa variable
x= "John"  # a is of type string
print(x)

# get the type ofa variable
print(type(x))

# python allows to assign values to multiple variables in one line
p, q, r = "red", "blue", "green"
print(p)
print(q)
print(r)

#we can use + operator or comma to generate output multiple variable
print(p, q, r)
print(p + q + r)
print(p+" "+ q +" "+ r)
